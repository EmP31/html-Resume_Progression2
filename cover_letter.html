        <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
        <p>I am currently a Senior Medical Laboratory Scientist, where I have been responsible for the chemistry department during two CAP (College of American Pathology) inspections. Soon after starting with South Lake Hospital I took on the role of interim blood bank supervisor.  I had only a few weeks to learn everything I needed to maintain the technical and administrative sides of the blood bank, as a result of my efforts I won the award for Beginning Practitioner of the year for Allied Health.  Once a supervisor was found I continued to be in charge of blood bank audits where I verify transfusion requirements, documentation completeness, and adherence to the transfusion policies in place. During my tenure at South Lake Hospital I have taken on the role as a super user for two different lab information systems.  This role requires me to scenario and stress test the system when upgrades and new processes are being implemented.  I have also been a part of a health information system changes over, for which I became one of the principle people to prepare the lab by validating content and interfaces.</p>
		<p>I chose to go into science because I love to learn.  I enjoy being a part of projects that expand my understanding of something or teach me something completely new.  I am currently at the tail end of the Google Certificates Data Analytics program.  Additionally, I am taking a supplemental course in SQL to improve my skills as well as learning Python.</p>
		<p>As a laboratory scientist I know the importance of maintaining the highest level of quality.  The work we do influences the course of treatment a patient receives.  I have had the opportunity to go beyond my basic scope of work and dive into helping improve the processes that govern how we and other departments work and provide care.  I am a fast and eager learner that enjoys a challenge.  The opportunities that I have had have made me want to branch out into a more quality and data driven role.  I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
		<p>Thank you,</p>
